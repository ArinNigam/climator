## Our Goal

The objective of making of this app is to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. We'll look at how to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet.


## What this App is all about

This is weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Valentine Chike](https://dribbble.com/shots/16952894-Weather-App). It is able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
